[Intro]
F Am C-alt C  F Am G C
(2x)


[Verse]
F                        Am         C-alt            C
She'll lie and steal and cheat, and beg you from her knees
    F                   Am    G       C
And make you thinks she means it this time
F                     Am       C-alt           C
She'll tear a hole in you, the one you can't repair 
    F                 Am      G      C
But I still love her, I don't really care 


[Bridge]
F            C      Am     G     
When we were young, Oh Oh, we did enough
F           C      Am      G             
When it got cold, Ooh Ooh, we bundled up
F         C     Am    G                C
I cant be told, Ah Ah It cant be done


[Verse]
F                 Am           C-alt      C
It's better to feel pain, than nothing at all
    F           Am       G    C
The opposite of love's indifference
F             Am       C-alt            Am    G         C
Pay attention now, I'm standing on your porch screaming out
    F              Am      G        C
And I wont leave until you come downstairs


[Chorus]
F                 C/G           G    Am
So keep your head up, keep your love
F              C/G    G    Am
keep your head up, my love 
F              C/G    G    Am
keep your head up, my love 
F              C/G           G    Am
Keep your head up, keep your love


[Verse]
F                Am       C-alt            Am   G         C
I don't blame ya dear for running like you did, all these years
    F          Am         G       C
I would do the same, your best believe
F                           Am         C-alt              Am     G  C
The highway signs say we're close, but I don't read those things anymore
  F             Am G   C
I never trusted my own eyes


[Bridge]
F            C      Am     G    
When we were young oh oh, we did enough
F            C      Am     G    
When it got cold, Ooh ooh we bundled up
F         C     Am    G                  C
I can't be told, Ah ah, can't be done


[Chorus]
F                 C/G           G    Am
So keep your head up, keep your love
F              C/G    G    Am
keep your head up, my love 
F              C/G    G    Am
keep your head up, my love 
F              C/G           G    Am
Keep your head up, keep your love
