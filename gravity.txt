[Intro]

For the intro, Just play G and C, listen to the song and ull hear the switch
Now for the rest of the song u use these chords, its quite simple:


[Chorus]

G                   C
Gravity is working against me
    G                         C
And gravity wants to bring me down


[Verse 1]

        Am
Oh I'll never know what makes this man
     D7
With all the love that his heart can stand
Gm/Bb          Ebmaj7          D7
Dream of ways to throw it all away

[Chorus]

G                   C
Gravity is working against me
    G                         C
And gravity wants to bring me down

[Verse 2]

   Am
Oh twice as much aint twice as good
    D7
And can't sustain like a one half could
    Gm/Bb 
It's wanting more,
            Ebmaj7           D7
That's gonna send me to my knees

[Guitar Solo]

 After this, the little solo comes in and once again, all u play is 2 chords, Just G and C
ull know when to switch cause ull hear it. After that, u repeat the same lyrics and do 
same chords:


[Verse 3]

   Am
Oh twice as much aint twice as good
    D7
And can't sustain like a one half could
    Gm/Bb 
It's wanting more,
            Ebmaj7           D7
That's gonna send me to my knees

[Chorus]

   G                      C
Oh gravity, stay the hell away from me
   G                         C
Oh gravity has taken better men than me

How can that be?

[Outro]

                       G
Just keep me where the light is
                       C
Just keep me where the light is
                       G
Just keep me where the light is
                          C
Come on keep me where the light is
                          G
Come on keep me where the light is
                       C
Come on keep me where, keep me where the light is
