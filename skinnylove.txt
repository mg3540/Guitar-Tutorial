[Verse]
Am             F                  C
Come on skinny love just last the year
Am             F                   C
Pour a little salt we were never here
        Am        F                     C
My my my - my my my - my my my my - my my ...
               Dm                        Am
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
Am        F                C
I tell my love to wreck it all
Am              F                C
Fut out all the ropes and let me fall
        Am        F                    C
My my my - my my my - my my my my my
             Am                 Am
Right in the moment this order's tall

[Chorus]
  C                        Am            F
I told you to be patient I told you to be fine
  C                        Am            F
I told you to be balanced I told you to be kind
         C
In the morning I'll be with you
            Am              F
But it will be a different kind
          C
I'll be holding all the tickets
               Am            F
And you'll be owning all the fines

[Verse]
Am            F                 C
Come on skinny love what happened here
Am            F                  C
Suckle on the hope in lite brassiere
        Am        F                  C
My my my - my my my - my my my - my my ...
        Dm                         Am
Sullen load is full so slow on the split

[Chorus]
   C                        Am           F
I told you to be patient I told you to be fine
   C                       Am            F
I told you to be balanced I told you to be kind
     C                           Am             F
Now all your love is wasted then who the hell was I?
                C
Cause now I'm breaking at the britches
           Am              F
And at the end of all your lines

[Bridge]
C                  Am         F
Who will love you? who will fight?
C                  Am      F
And who will fall, far behind?
Am             F           C   F
Come on skinny love ........
        Am        F                     C
My my my - my my my - my my my - my my ...
        Am        F                     C
My my my - my my my - my my my - my my ...

[Outro]
Am  F  C
