  C                   Am     C
a year from now we'll all be gone
        Am           F    C
all our friends will move away
            Am       F      C
and they're going to better places
        Am           F       C
but our friends will be gone away

C             Am     C
nothing is as it has been
      Am        F         C
and i miss your face like hell
      Am         F       C
and i guess it's just as well
      Am        F         C
but i miss your face like hell
