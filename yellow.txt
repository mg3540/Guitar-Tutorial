[Verse 1]

C
Look at the stars
                       G
Look how they shine for you
                     F
And everything you do

Yeah, they were all yellow
C
I came along
                  G
I wrote a song for you
                         F
And all the things you do

And it was called yellow
C                     G
     So then I took my turn
                            F
Oh what a thing to have done
                              C
And it was all yellow


[Chorus 1]

F        Am              G
 Your skin, oh yeah your skin and bones
F      Am            G
 Turn into something beautiful
F      Am             G          
 You know, you know I love you so
F 
      You know I love you so

I swam across
                   G 
I jumped across for you
                      F
Oh, what a thing to do

'Cause you were all yellow
C 
I drew a line
                 G
I drew a line for you
                      F
Oh, what a thing to do 
                           C
And it was all yellow



[Chorus 2]

F        Am              G
 Your skin, oh yeah your skin and bones
F      Am            G
 Turn into something beautiful
F       Am             G
 You know, for you I'd bleed myself dry
