The song is in standard tuning, capo on the 4th fret.

The intro has this as the basic melody with Seth going back and forth between these 
notes and the root note of the chord above:

 G                                        C

[Verse 1]

G                                              C
Hurts so bad, you don't come around here anymore.
G
Worse than that, nothing's really helping
           C                       G
I've been thinking 'bout drinking again.

G
It's alright if you finally stop caring,
                                    C
Just don't go and tell someone that does.
   Am                C
Cause even though I know there's hope
   Am             G
In every morning song,
   Am                 C  D    G
I have to find that melody alone.


[Verse 2]

(same pattern as verse 1)

G
Her name became the flame unto the fire.
                               C
A magpie on a wire, warned of those.
Am             C     Am           C     D       G
Dead unto the high, shamelessly alive unto the low.

G
It's alright if you finally stop caring,
                                    C
Just don't go and tell someone that does.
   Am                C
Cause even though I know there's hope
   Am             G
In every morning song,
   Am                 C  D    G
I have to find that melody alone.


[Bridge]

 Am                F
We can go ahead if no one notices.
 C                        G
What's the point of it I have to ask?
 Am                         F
Or how you learn to see the hope eternally
 C                            G
When you're sure to be, oh...even less.


[Verse 3]

C                                            F
Hurts so bad., more than I expected that it would.
C
Worse than that, it seems to be here lasting
        F                       C
Just a little longer than it should.

G
It's alright if you finally stop caring,
                                    C
Just don't go and tell someone that does.
   Am                C
Cause even though I know there's hope
   Am             G
In every morning song,
   Am                 C  D    G
I have to find that melody alone.

 Am                  C  D    G
I have to find that melody alone.
 Am                  C  D    G
I have to find that melody alone.
 Am                  C  D    G
I have to find that melody alone.
 Am                  C       G
I have to sing that melody alone.
